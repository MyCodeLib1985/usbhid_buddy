v0.1:
* frist!!! release
----

v0.2:
x1. shrink size back down a bit
x2. see if can get away with a 2 layer with GND and +3.3V pour on TOP/BTTM
x3. footprint fixes
   a. 10 pin header needs a silkscreen outline for pins. center and move over.
x4. fix C8051F380 bad pin 12 with 100R to GND when it really should go
   to VBUS.
x5. footprint for the ESD protection diode is bad needs to be fixed
x6. footprint for +5V regulator/reference should be widened for pads
x7. the location of the 10-pin 2 row header is wacky and should be centered
x8. look into mechanical enclosure for entire unit with eye to remove 
  dual row headers.

  alternatively adopt the bus pirate mech footprint standard.

**RESIZED to BUS PIRATE V3.6 FOOTPRINT**

XX9. (potentially use ADG1414BRUZ-REEL7 as an octal SPST switch to isolate DAC
       and ADC so they can coexist on same pins) or MAX335 or MAX395.

** ATTEMPT IN SOFTWARE TO VERIFY IF DAC CAN BE POWERED OFF AND SAME ATTACHED
  CHANNEL USED AS ADC WITH EXTERNAL VOLTAGE STIMULUS **

not required, will not be implemented in v0.2

x10. USB VBUS power LED indicator
x11. change the micro USB connector out for the EOL Hirose to a a standard SMD
   mount with a non-reversed connector

v0.3:
1. rearrange buttons and LEDs to fit the existing enclosure footprint
x2. move 10 pin header back 1.1 mm to fit into enclosure.  size check
x3. fix the USBDP and USBDN routing issue
x4. make footprint for TPS 5V reference larger
-?5. make footprint for dual color LED slightly larger
x6. rounded edge corners
x7. make corner holes larger, 2.7mm -> 3.2mm+ **(made to 3.2mm PAD)
x8. make red/green bicolor LED active low
x9. move ADC0_IN and ADC1_IN to P0.6 and P0.7 for interrupt capability
x10. look into benefit of additional crystal oscillator for timing tolerance improvement
 (added a 32.768 kHz watch crystal for millis timer and ADC sampling trigger clock)
----

v0.4:
x1. add SPI SRAM buffer
?2. fix bad GND pour DRC issued with pin 6 on chip U2.
-3. make USB1 connector to use slotted holes for mechanical robustness (not this revision)
x4. add protection diodes to ADC and DAC channels
x5. add picoblade programming header on bottom of board to mate to C2 adapter board
x6. switch ADC0_IN and ADC1_IN from P0.6 and P0.7 as they can't be allocated for ADC
x7. add a USB polyfuse
x8. add SPI testpads on backside of board
x9. add health indicator LED for 1 second interval flashing
-10. add testpoint for spare GPIO
NO 11. switch red and green bicolor LED back to active high cfg
x12. remove watch crystal
x13. make VREF (P1.5) connected to a 2.5V reference
x14. add MISO connection to read out TLV563x parameters
x15. add tristate buffer to MISO/SOMI lines for TLV563x and 23LC1024 module 
x16. fix incorrect naming scheme, DAC_OUTA = ADC0_IN
NO 17. consider backside mezzanine connector to mate for mating to a breakout DB
	or bulk screw-terminal board.
x18. add 10 uF and 100 pF decoupling cap on PIN16 of TLV563X for internal voltage ref
  as recommended by the datasheet. 
x19. add 4.8 uF and 0.1 uF bypass capacitor on P1.5 reference pin on C8051F380 chip
