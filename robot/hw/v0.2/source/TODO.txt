v0.2:
 x * resisitive divider from FIO pins on the ADC.  Place the divider network
   on the ADC pin side of the multiplexor.  The divider should bring 5V max
   to 3.3V.
 x * LED indicators on board driven by Teensy to indicate when test is ongoing
 and maybe a visual indicator for pass/fail.
 x * replace teensy 3.2 with teensy 3.6 for the the additional RAM and CPU.
 (NO) consider usage of secondary ADC and DAC as a means to perhaps scan for
  crosstalk measurements.
 x * use +5V logic almost everywhere.  Replace 3.3V with 5.0V on MAX335 and
 MAX4617..
 (THERE) consider SD card access to save logs on teensy?
* test points or some secondary header to expose FIO_0 - FIO_7 for
saleae analyzer.
